A cow stood in the middle of a field eating grass. She had lived at this dairy farm her whole life, and loved nothing more than eating as much grass as she could find.
One day, as she was eating grass on the dairy farm, she began to hear strange noises coming from the sky. Her friends all around her began to flee in terror as a large spaceship descended on the dairy farm, kidnapping cows while wreaking havoc all across the land.

However,after several days, those kidnapped cows returned to the field with changed genes. Those cows now were able to change their skin's color through Monday to Sunday with rainbow colors. However, on the eighth day after they came back, all the cows turned into transparent. The owner of the farm was very anxious, and tried to find the cows.

The transparent cows "mooed" to try and tell the farmer that they were there, but the farmer could hear them but not see them, which made him even more anxious. Finally, the farmer bumped into one of the cows that were now transparent, and felt around this invisible cow to make sure it was actually a cow. Of course, it was, and when he tried to milk it, it's milk was transparent and invisible too, all while tasting just like regular uprocessesed, fresh udder squirts. The farmer then thought: "Im rich! Invisible milk will sell like hot cakes! Gotta start this buisness venture now." and proceeded to round up and start milking all the invisible cows, and setting up buisness-related things to start this highly profitable buisness.
