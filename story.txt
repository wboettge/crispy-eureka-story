A cow stood in the middle of a field eating grass. She had lived at this dairy farm her whole life, and loved nothing more than eating as much grass as she could find.
One day, as she was eating grass on the dairy farm, she began to hear strange noises coming from the sky. Her friends all around her began to flee in terror as a large spaceship descended on the dairy farm, kidnapping cows while wreaking havoc all across the land.
